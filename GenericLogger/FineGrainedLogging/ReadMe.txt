It demonstrates fine grained logging.  The Lumberjack framework supports much more than simple log levels.  For example, you might want to categorize your log statements according to functionality.  This would allow you to toggle log statements according to the modules you are currently developing.  For example:

DDLogAudio(@"Low audio volume");
DDLogVideo(@"Switching to Video scale 0.3");

It could even be more advanced than this. You might have log levels within the separate log statements.  For example:

DDLogFreezeWarn(@"High image quality attempted at Low bandwidth");
DDLogCommunicationsVerbose(@"Video Pipe reports continuous frame drops of more than 4 frames");

Then you could change log levels per module.

As you can see, the framework is very flexible. Each project may have different logging requirements, and you can customize the framework to match your needs.
