A logger that makes your app stronger by means of providing a number 
of out of the box features. A tool that gives your iOs/Mac developers 
an excellent way of knowing what's happening inside the application.

The developers can see it at runtime as and when the user does something 
using their app. This "Live logging" is supported on browsers which 
support websockets.

Your can also change the log level at runtime specifying the log level
via flags.

simply run the demo app included in the framework and point your Mac 
browser to http://<IP of your device>:12345 to see it magically working!

Enjoy!
