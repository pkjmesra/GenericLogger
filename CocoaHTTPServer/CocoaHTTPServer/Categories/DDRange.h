/**
 * DDRange is the functional equivalent of a 64 bit NSRange.
 * The HTTP Server is designed to support very large files.
 * On 32 bit architectures (ppc, i386) NSRange uses unsigned 32 bit integers.
 * This only supports a range of up to 4 gigabytes.
 * By defining our own variant, we can support a range up to 16 exabytes.
 * 
 * All effort is given such that DDRange functions EXACTLY the same as NSRange.
